## Nike Shoe Customizer
Look no further than my latest project - a stunning Three.js website with a dynamic black background and floating 3D objects that's perfect for any sneaker shop app!

With this website, users can easily customize their shoes in real-time by choosing from a wide range of colors and textures, zooming in for a closer look, and rotating the shoe to see every angle. Plus, the striking black background provides the perfect contrast to really make those Nike shoes pop!

And the best part? I created all of the materials for this project using Blender, showcasing my skills and creativity in web development and 3D graphics programming.

So whether you're a sneakerhead looking to create your perfect pair of Nikes, or a business looking to elevate your online storefront, my customizer website is the perfect solution. Try it out today and see the difference for yourself!
